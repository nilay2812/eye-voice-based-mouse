**Eye-Controlled Mouse and Voice Commands**

  This project combines eye-tracking technology and voice commands to create an innovative and hands-free computer interaction experience.
  The program allows users to control the mouse cursor using their eyes and execute various commands through voice input.


**Requirements** >

  -Python 3.x
  
  -OpenCV (pip install opencv-python)
  
  -Mediapipe (pip install mediapipe)
  
  -PyAutoGUI (pip install pyautogui)
  
  -SpeechRecognition (pip install SpeechRecognition)
  

  
**Usage** >

  -Eye Tracking Mode
  
  -Run the script.
  
  -Press the 'e' key to switch to eye-tracking mode.
  
  -Use your webcam to detect eye movements.
  
  -The program will track your left eye. If the eye is closed, a left click will be simulated.
  
  -Additionally, the program detects specific hand gestures for cursor movement and clicks.
  

  
**Voice Command Mode** >

  -Run the script.
  
  -Press the 'v' key to switch to voice command mode.
  
  -The program will listen for voice commands using your microphone.
  
  -Speak commands like "scroll up," "scroll down," "move up," "move down," "move left," "move right," "left click," and "exit now."
  
  -The program will execute corresponding actions based on the voice commands.
  


**Notes** >

  -To exit the program, use the voice command "exit now" or close the window.
  
  -Ensure your webcam and microphone are properly configured and accessible.
  
  -Experiment with different lighting conditions for better eye-tracking accuracy.
